# ClusterFuzzLite
ClusterFuzzLite is a continuous [fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)
solution that runs as part of
[Continuous Integration (CI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before.
With just a few lines of code, GitHub users can integrate ClusterFuzzLite into
their workflow and fuzz pull requests to catch bugs before they are committed.

ClusterFuzzLite is based on [ClusterFuzz](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzz/).

## Features

- Quick code change (pull request) fuzzing to find bugs before they land
- Downloads of crashing testcases
- Continuous longer running fuzzing (batch fuzzing) to asynchronously find
   deeper bugs missed during code change fuzzing and build a corpus for
   use in code change fuzzing
- Coverage reports showing which parts of your code are fuzzed
- Modular functionality, so you can decide which features you want to use
