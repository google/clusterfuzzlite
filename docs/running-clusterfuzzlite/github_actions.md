This page explains how to set up ClusterFuzzLite to run on [GitHub Actions].
To get the most of this page, you should have already set up your
[build integration] and read the more
[high-level document on running ClusterFuzzLite].

## Workflow Files
For basic ClusterFuzzLite functionality, all you need is a single workflow file
to enable fuzzing on your pull requests.

- `.github/workflows/cflite_pr.yml` (for PR fuzzing)

To enable more features, we recommend having these additional files:

- `.github/workflows/cflite_build.yml` (for continuous builds)
- `.github/workflows/cflite_batch.yml` (for batch fuzzing)
- `.github/workflows/cflite_cron.yml` (for tasks done on a cron schedule)

These workflow files are used by GitHub actions to run the ClusterFuzzLite
actions.
For a complete example on a real project, see
<https://github.com/oliverchang/curl>.

## Mode Configurations

The following configuration guides show default configuration settings for each workflow file. 
Simply copying the default settings should work for most projects, or you can choose to edit the files to customize the settings.

### PR fuzzing

To add a fuzzing workflow that fuzzes all pull requests to your repo, add the
following default configurations to `.github/workflows/cflite_pr.yml`:

{% raw %}
```yaml
name: ClusterFuzzLite PR fuzzing
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**'
permissions: read-all
jobs:
  PR:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        sanitizer:
        - address
        # Override this with the sanitizers you want.
        # - undefined
        # - memory
    steps:
    - name: Build Fuzzers (${{ matrix.sanitizer }})
      id: build
      uses: google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/build_fuzzers@v1
      with:
        sanitizer: ${{ matrix.sanitizer }}
        # Optional but recommended: used to only run fuzzers that are affected
        # by the PR.
        # See later section on "Git repo for storage".
        # storage-repo: https://${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}@github.com/OWNER/STORAGE-REPO-NAME.git
        # storage-repo-branch: main   # Optional. Defaults to "main"
        # storage-repo-branch-coverage: gh-pages  # Optional. Defaults to "gh-pages".
    - name: Run Fuzzers (${{ matrix.sanitizer }})
      id: run
      uses: google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/run_fuzzers@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        fuzz-seconds: 600
        mode: 'code-change'
        sanitizer: ${{ matrix.sanitizer }}
        # Optional but recommended: used to download the corpus produced by
        # batch fuzzing.
        # See later section on "Git repo for storage".
        # storage-repo: https://${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}@github.com/OWNER/STORAGE-REPO-NAME.git
        # storage-repo-branch: main   # Optional. Defaults to "main"
        # storage-repo-branch-coverage: gh-pages  # Optional. Defaults to "gh-pages".
```
{% endraw %}

Optionally, edit the following fields to customize your settings:
- `sanitizers` Change or enable more sanitizers. 
- `fuzz-seconds` Change the amount of time spent fuzzing. 
- `storage-repo`, `storage-repo-branch`,
  `storage-repo-branch-coverage` Enable a [storage repo] (not necessary for initial runs, but a useful feature discussed [later on]).

Merge this file into your GitHub repo.
To test the workflow, open a pull request to your project.

To download crashes from code change fuzzing, please see the [section
on downloading artifacts].

[later on]: #storage-repo

### Batch fuzzing

Batch fuzzing enables continuous, regular fuzzing on your latest HEAD and
allows a corpus of inputs to build up over time, which greatly improves the
effectiveness of fuzzing. Batch fuzzing can be run on either pushes to your default branch or on a cron schedule (or both).

To enable batch fuzzing, add the following to
`.github/workflows/cflite_batch.yml`:

{% raw %}
```yaml
name: ClusterFuzzLite batch fuzzing
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0/6 * * *'  # Every 6th hour. Change this to whatever is suitable.
permissions: read-all
jobs:
  BatchFuzzing:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        sanitizer:
        - address
        # Override this with the sanitizers you want.
        # - undefined
        # - memory
    steps:
    - name: Build Fuzzers (${{ matrix.sanitizer }})
      id: build
      uses: google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/build_fuzzers@v1
      with:
        sanitizer: ${{ matrix.sanitizer }}
    - name: Run Fuzzers (${{ matrix.sanitizer }})
      id: run
      uses: google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/run_fuzzers@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        fuzz-seconds: 3600
        mode: 'batch'
        sanitizer: ${{ matrix.sanitizer }}
        # Optional but recommended: For storing certain artifacts from fuzzing.
        # See later section on "Git repo for storage".
        # storage-repo: https://${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}@github.com/OWNER/STORAGE-REPO-NAME.git
        # storage-repo-branch: main   # Optional. Defaults to "main"
        # storage-repo-branch-coverage: gh-pages  # Optional. Defaults to "gh-pages".
```
{% endraw %}

Optionally, edit the following fields to customize your settings:
- `cron` Change how frequently batch fuzzing is run. See [GitHub's documentation] on this.
- `sanitizers` Change or enable more sanitizers. 
- `fuzz-seconds` Change the amount of time spent fuzzing.
- `storage-repo`, `storage-repo-branch`,
  `storage-repo-branch-coverage` Enable a [storage repo]. 

To configure batch fuzzing to run on each push to your main branch, change the `on` field to:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Use your actual default branch here.
```
Make sure to change `branches` to the actual branch(es) you wish to
fuzz.

NOTE: If batch fuzzing is running, you must also run [corpus pruning].

[GitHub's documentation]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule

### Continuous builds

The continuous build task causes a build to be triggered and uploaded as a GitHub Actions artifact
whenever a new push is done to main/default branch.

Continuous builds are used when a crash is found during PR fuzzing to determine whether the crash was newly introduced.
If the crash is not novel, code change/PR fuzzing will not report it.
This means that there will be fewer unrelated failures when running code change
fuzzing.

To set up continuous builds, add the following to `.github/workflows/cflite_build.yml`:

{% raw %}
```yaml
name: ClusterFuzzLite continuous builds
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Use your actual default branch here.
permissions: read-all
jobs:
  Build:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   strategy:
     fail-fast: false
     matrix:
        sanitizer:
        - address
        # Override this with the sanitizers you want.
        # - undefined
        # - memory
   steps:
   - name: Build Fuzzers (${{ matrix.sanitizer }})
     id: build
     uses: google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/build_fuzzers@v1
     with:
       sanitizer: ${{ matrix.sanitizer }}
       upload-build: true
```
{% endraw %}

NOTE: Be sure to change the `branches` field to whatever is your project's main branch. 

If you plan to use multiple sanitizers, add them all to the `sanitizer` field (to enable builds for each sanitizer)

### Corpus pruning

Corpus pruning minimizes the corpus produced by batch fuzzing by removing
redundant items while keeping the same code coverage. To enable this, add the
following to `.github/workflows/cflite_cron.yml`:

{% raw %}
```yaml
name: ClusterFuzzLite cron tasks
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Once a day at midnight.
permissions: read-all
jobs:
  Pruning:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Build Fuzzers
      id: build
      uses: google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/build_fuzzers@v1
    - name: Run Fuzzers
      id: run
      uses: google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/run_fuzzers@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        fuzz-seconds: 600
        mode: 'prune'
        # Optional but recommended.
        # See later section on "Git repo for storage".
        # storage-repo: https://${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}@github.com/OWNER/STORAGE-REPO-NAME.git
        # storage-repo-branch: main   # Optional. Defaults to "main"
        # storage-repo-branch-coverage: gh-pages  # Optional. Defaults to "gh-pages".
```
{% endraw %}

Optionally, edit the following field to customize your settings:

- `storage-repo`, `storage-repo-branch`,
  `storage-repo-branch-coverage` Enable a [storage repo].

### Coverage reports

To generate periodic coverage reports, add the following to the `jobs` field in
`.github/workflows/cflite_cron.yml` after the `Pruning` job:

{% raw %}
```yaml
jobs:
  Coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Build Fuzzers
      id: build
      uses: google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/build_fuzzers@v1
      with:
        sanitizer: coverage
    - name: Run Fuzzers
      id: run
      uses: google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/run_fuzzers@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        fuzz-seconds: 600
        mode: 'coverage'
        sanitizer: 'coverage'
        # Optional but recommended.
        # See later section on "Git repo for storage".
        # storage-repo: https://${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}@github.com/OWNER/STORAGE-REPO-NAME.git
        # storage-repo-branch: main   # Optional. Defaults to "main"
        # storage-repo-branch-coverage: gh-pages  # Optional. Defaults to "gh-pages".
```
{% endraw %}

Optionally, edit the following fields to view coverage reports at
`https://USERNAME.github.io/STORAGE-REPO-NAME/coverage/latest/report/linux/report.html`:
-  set `storage-repo` ([instructions here])
- set `storage-repo-branch-coverage` to "gh-pages" (the
default)


![github-actions-coverage-report]

### Downloading artifacts

To download an artifact from a ClusterFuzzLite run:
- Click on the summary from the run.
![github-actions-summary]
- Click on the artifact you with to download from the summary page.
![github-actions-download-crash]

## Extra configuration

### Git repo for storage {#storage-repo}

It's optional but recommended that you set up a
separate git repo for storing corpora and coverage reports.
The storage repo will make corpus management better in
some scenarios and will allow you to view coverage reports on the web rather than downloading them as artifacts.

An empty repository for this is sufficient.

You'll need to set up a [personal access token] with write permissions to the
storage repo and add it as a [repository secret] called
`PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
This is because the default GitHub auth token is not able to write to other
repositories.
Note: if you run into [issues with the storage repo], you may have
accidentally set the secret as an *environment secret* instead of a
*repository secret*.
![new-repo-secret]
![personal-access-token]

If you would like PR fuzzing to run only the fuzzers affected by the current
change, you'll need to add these same options to the ["Build Fuzzers" step
above](#pr-fuzzing). The "affected fuzzers" are determined by using
coverage reports, which require a storage repo.

If a storage repo isn't specified, corpora and coverage reports will be uploaded as
GitHub artifacts instead. 

[personal access token]: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
[repository secret]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-environment
[issues with the storage repo]: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/6668

### Private repos

In order for ClusterFuzzLite to clone private repos, the GitHub token needs to
be passed to the build steps.
This token is automaticallly set by GitHub actions so no extra action is
required from you except passing it to build fuzzers in each workflow file:

{% raw %}
```yaml
    steps:
    - name: Build Fuzzers
      id: build
      uses: google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/build_fuzzers@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

{% endraw %}
